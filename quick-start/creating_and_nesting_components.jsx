// React apps are made out of components. 
// A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

// React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

    function MyButton() {
        return (
            <button>Eu sou um botão</button>
        );
    }

    // Now that you’ve declared MyButton, you can nest it into another component:

    export default function MyApp() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
                <MyButton />
            </div>
        );
    }

// Notice that <MyButton /> starts with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React component. React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

// The 'export default' keywords specify the "main component" in the file.
